Several measures of adherence to multiple medications (polypharmacy) have been reported in the literature as averaged metrics from single 
medications. Because they are historical and were not developed to estimate polypharmacy, the formulae represent a gross approximation of the 
actual medication intake and were therefore criticized. 

 study comparing different calculation methods showed that the use of MPR for more
than one medication overestimates adherence, predominantly due to the presence of duplication [4]. Since the
‘‘average MPR’’ does not account for the number of
medications, the frequency of medication switching, the
duplication, the overlapping, or the unexpected and sameday refills, it can hardly reflect the actual adherence that it
was intended to measure. Thus, MPR methods are inadequate for quantifying adherence to polypharmacy
regimens.

daily polypharmacy possession ratio DPPR is a more robust method of measuring adherence than the traditional 
medication possession ratio (MPR) MPR methods, as it accounts for oversupply and thus leads to a more sound measure if the assumption for dose is incorrect.
This index considers the presence or absence of multiple medications on each day in the
observation period. It quantifies polypharmacy adherence as the percentage of medications daily available. This
approach accounts for the specificity of polypharmacy such as the number of medications and frequency of medication switching. It also eliminates duplication and overlapping,
the parameters responsible for the general overestimation of adherence.

Hence, the DPPR accounts for oversupply solely to compensate a subsequent gap (timeforward-approach),
and excludes oversupply beyond the end date which was shown to overestimate adherence measures by 
enlarging the value of the quantity dispensed. This is a disadvantage of the MPR methods because they count 
oversupplies and can lead to extreme outliers relative to the DPPR. However, because standardization of all variables 
is an integral part of the DPPR measure, it delivers a more realistic value of medication use and can be used in adherence research and for policy makers

What is period of time allowed between the end of one prescription and the start of the next?
Determine the onset of cessation:
Mathematically, it amounts to setting a specific period of time (or threshold) that needs to be exceeded after the supply from the previous refill 
ends.

defining end date:
DATEADD(DAY, DaysSupply-1, ServiceDate) AS ServiceEndDate

ASSUMPTIONS and BIAS
stockpiling prior to the start date, 
therapeutic switching and non-persistence, 
dosage instructions, 
end date,  
temporary gaps such as hospitalization, 
which can be summarized in elements related to the patient, the medication or the system.

Medication switch occurs when a subject initially fills a prescription
for one product, then at a later point fills a prescription for a different
product in the same therapeutic class and never refills the first product
within the observation period. **Ask Alan**

Therapeutic duplication is defined as multiple medication use within the same therapeutic class, and can result from therapeutic augmentation; prescription error must be excluded.
therapeutic switching and therapeutic duplication should be considered as one medication (no duplication), and changes in dosage should be recognised and accounted for.
What do we do about overlapping prescriptions? is this what therapeautic duplication stands for? **Ask Alan**

observation period:
Medication should assumed to be taken continuously throughout observation period. 
SEE: Operationalization and validation of DPPR ---> Hence, we accounted for oversupply for brand switching but not for therapeutic switching.**Ask Alan**

we treated each initialized medication as if maintained until the end of the observation window. By doing this, we assumed that no treatment 
interruption or temporary discontinuation occurred during 
the observation window, thus excluding therapy cessation 
(so-called non-persistence)

length of the time over which adherence is assessed --
Setting the start date:
When does first intake occur? Concern: stockpiling. A look-back period can be included to identify if medication was dispensed previously.
Adjusting original quantity values with the previous stockpile.

--- whatever comes first between end date of study or end date of last refill
observation period, i.e., the length of thetime over which adherence is assessed, may start and end at a
specific fill and refill date; on arbitrary start/stop dates that areset as the index or inventory date and are independent from
fills and refills; or a combination of a fixed and an arbitrary date.

hospitalization:
If readmissions are included 
in the observation window, and the hospitalization period is 
known, it should be subtracted from the denominator of the 
metrics, assuming complete adherence to hospital medications during hospital stay.

medicines dispensed implies medicines ingested.

Dosage:
Not included.
Calculated via MetricDecimalQuantity  / DaysSupply 
This may have underestimated usage if a higher dose was prescribed or overestimated the dose if the patient was instructed to 
take half the dose in the case of tablets that can be cut in half.
